# Enabling a Yum Repository
# To enable a particular repository or repositories, type the following at a shell prompt as root:
#
# yum-config-manager --enable repository…
#
# …where repository is the unique repository ID (use yum repolist all to list available repository IDs). Alternatively, you can use a glob expression to enable all matching repositories:
#
# yum-config-manager --enable glob_expression…
  # Add RPM repo
}
