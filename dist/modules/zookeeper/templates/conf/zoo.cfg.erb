# To avoid seeks ZooKeeper allocates space in the transaction log file in

# Clients can submit requests faster than ZooKeeper can process them,
# especially if there are a lot of clients. To prevent ZooKeeper from running
# out of memory due to queued requests, ZooKeeper will throttle clients so that
# there is no more than globalOutstandingLimit outstanding requests in the
# system. The default limit is 1,000.ZooKeeper logs transactions to a
# transaction log. After snapCount transactions are written to a log file a
# snapshot is started and a new transaction log file is started. The default
# snapCount is 10,000.
